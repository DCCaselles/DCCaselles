## Hi there 👋


I'm a PhD student at the University of Florida in the College of Design, Construction, and Planning (Go Gators!). I work on understanding the relationship between the natural and built environment to find solutions to resource (water, energy, that kind of thing) shortage problems 

🔭 I’m currently working on understanding water pollution around urban areas \\
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on risk assessments and sustainable development ideas
🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding urban dynamics and data analysis techniques
💬 Ask me about river's health and water pollution issues
📫 How to reach me:
- I'm just an email away at dcorreacaselles@ufl.edu
😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers 
⚡ Fun fact: I love playing basketball 

**DCCaselles/DCCaselles** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
